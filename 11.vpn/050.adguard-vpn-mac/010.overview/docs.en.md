AdGuard VPN for Mac is a desktop VPN service. It is currently in the beta stage, but it doesn’t mean that the app is raw. Quite the opposite, it is working stable and can be used. AdGuard VPN is fully compatible with AdGuard ad blocker, they can be used together and will operate seamlessly. Let’s see what features it has to offer.

## Home screen

The first tab is the *Home* screen. Here you can see AdGuard VPN current status and [operating mode](https://kb.adguard-vpn.com/en/mac-vpn/features-overview#exclusions), chosen location (if enabled) and its ping. The fastest locations with the lowest pings are displayed in the upper right corner of the screen. Below you can see the full list of locations. Through the search function, the needed location can be easily found. 

> Free users can connect only to certain locations, while others are blocked. Besides, there is a 3GB monthly traffic limit in the free version.

## Exclusions

Next goes the *Exclusions* screen. AdGuard VPN has several features that make it unique, and one of them is certainly switching between two operating modes. In the Regular mode, AdGuard VPN will run on all websites but the ones from the exclusions list. In the Selective mode, conversely, AdGuard VPN will run only on websites from the exclusions list. You yourself can decide where you want VPN to work.

What’s more, ready-made exclusions lists can be transferred to other devices with the installed AdGuard VPN. [Learn how to export or import exclusions](https://adguard.com/en/blog/import-export-adguard-vpn.html).

## Support

The third tab is the *Support* screen. Find answers to any questions in the [FAQ](https://adguard-vpn.com/en/welcome.html#faq) or in the [Knowledge base](https://kb.adguard-vpn.com/en) sections, report a bug if you encounter one, or [discuss AdGuard on any of the six platforms](https://adguard.com/en/discuss.html).

Finally, we come to the most important tab — Settings. In the *About program* section you can see the current version of AdGuard VPN, check for updates, visit our official website, and get acquainted with AdGuard's EULA and Privacy policy. In the *About license* section you can upgrade from free to unlimited, manage your subscription, or log out. And most importantly, from here you can access *General settings*.

### General settings

The first three basic features make the application more convenient and user-friendly, i.e. *autoupdate*, *launch AdGuard VPN at login*, and *auto-connect on app launch*. What’s more, you can choose between light, dark, and system themes. The latter one matches the theme on your Mac. Last but not least, you can allow AdGuard VPN to gather and send anonymized crash reports, technical and interaction data in order to help us improve our app.

### Advanced settings

Advanced settings are also known as low-level ones. They are encouraged to be adjusted by users with solid technical knowledge/background.

#### Logging level
There are only two logging levels but we strongly recommend that you use the first, default one. The second option (extended logging) should be set only to record a strange program behavior after consulting our technical support. 

#### Hide menu bar icon 
Although this option is located in *Advanced settings*, it can be enabled without hesitation. You can hide the AdGuard VPN icon from the menu bar, it won’t prevent our app from running in the background.

Basically, that’s it. Another thing you should know is that AdGuard VPN for Mac is currently supported on Catalina and Big Sur. The support for older versions of macOS will be available shortly.
